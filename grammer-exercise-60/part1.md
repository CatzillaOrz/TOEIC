# 填空

1. Pesticides and chemical __ are becoming some of the worst water pollutants in America.
    - fertile (肥沃的)
    - fertility (肥沃)
    - **fertilizers (肥料)**
    - fertileness (肥沃性)

    - B **x**
    - **C**
    - 解析：填充的空格构成的句子主语的组成部分，但应该留意在形式上与 Pesticides 保持平行的性质。基本上说，这是属于考察词汇能力的题目。

1. Should the federal government give every American a medical ID number, making __ possible to track medical records.
    - it
    - him
    - one
    - that

    - **A**
    - 解析：如果注意到 making 或 to 不定式的 to track (追踪)，就可以知道空格内填入形式宾语 it，修饰在后面的 to 不定式或 that 从句 内容。 make it possible to do 意为“使……成为可能”。 the federal government 为 “联邦政府”， medical ID number 为 “医疗身份证号”

1. __ are more than thirty people eligible to be on the company's medical insurance plan.
    - They
    - All that

    - There

    - **D**
    - 解析：空格后接 be 动词  + 名词短语，名词短语是 more than thirty people eligible to (具有……资格的人超过30人)，关键在于这是 be 动词的标语还是主语 (there 结构)。不过，重点在于它是不是可以作为主语。

1. If the decision isn't favorable to us, please let me know as soon as possible so I can contact __ companies.
    - another
    - other
    - others
    - either

    - A **x**
    - **B**
    - 重点是搞清楚不定代词 another, other 的用法。another （另一个，另一人） another 后跟 复数 companies，肯定不正确。 other 作为形容词使用时置于复数名词前，意为“其他的，另外的”

    - will have

    - will be going
    - had been going

    - C **A**
    - 必须注意 By April of next year(到明年4月为止). go on a strike 意为： “发动罢工”。因此，重点是形成“到………为止，会发生罢工“这种将来完成时的句子。 will have + 过去分词
