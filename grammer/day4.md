        ask = 要求

    1. convince， inform，notify，persuade，tell，remind等动词，后面不可以直接跟that从句（=欠缺IO的形式）。不过，可以后接疑问句。

        **x** John didn't tell that they had left.

        **O** He seems (to be) happy.

    1. believe, command, consider, find, know, order, perceive, require, suppose, suspect, understand, imagine等动词，后面不能直接跟to不定式。不过，可以后接“O + to 不定式”的形式。
