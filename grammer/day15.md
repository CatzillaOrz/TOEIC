# 介词

1. 掌握介词的基本特征

    * 介词后面跟着宾语[for him (x he) **->** 成为宾语的是名词（相当于名词的短语）**->** 这里所谓的“相当于名词的短语”，除了代词之外，还包括下述几种：①动名词；②wh-短语；③wh-从句；④与部分介词连用的 that 从句等。]

    I'm looking forward to meeting you [what you will say].  ( ① 和 ③ ) / I wasn't certain of what to do. (②) / in [except] that...(④)

1. 掌握与引导从句的连词之间的差异

    * 介词无法像连词那样直接引导 S + V （从句）[x I was surprised at she noticed him. / The government provided food, for the people were hungry. (**->**连词的for)]

1. 弄清楚容易搞错的介词（短语）与连词或其他介词之间的组合

    * because of [due to] --because, for [during] --while, despite [in spite of] --though, in case of -- if; between -- among, beside -- beside, for -- during, by -- till [until], like -- as 等。
