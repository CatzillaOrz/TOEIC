# **关系副词**

1. **了解关系副词的基本功能**
    - “副词+连词”的功能
        - This is the house where (= in which) I was born.
        - Where = in which = in the house
        - in the house
        - 是表示场所的副词短语，但用 where 一个词却可取代。而且，where 兼具连词的作用，可将内容 **S - V** (This - is; I - was born)的两个句子链接起来成为一个句子。
        - **x** This is the house here [there] I was born.(here, there仅有副词的功能) (the house 是 where 的先行词)

1. **掌握主要的关系副词(where, when, why, how)的特征**
    - where 表示场所 (the house where...);
    - when 表示时间 (the day when...);
    - why 表示理由 (the reason why...)
    - 表示状态的 how, 以前面没有先行词为原则。 the way how...(不可或很少用) the way (in which)...
    - 也有先行词包含于其内的用法： This is where I was born. That's when he arrived here. This is why... That's how...
    - where 与 when 也有非限制的用法：Tokyo, where I was born...

1. **关系副词 最大的学习目标是正确地使用关系副词与关系代词**
    - the place where I was born [in which I was born, which I was born in.] / **x** the place which I was born [ where I was born in]
