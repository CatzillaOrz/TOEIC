# 相关连词

1. 了解相关连词

    - 并列习惯连词：both...and, either... or, neither.. nor, not only... but(also)
        - [这些连词中包含有并列连词(and, or, nor, but), 所以后面不能接语法范畴不同的成分]
            - x He not only cheated his friends, but also his parents.(动词短语对应名词短语)
            - He cheated not only his friend, but also his parents.(名词短语对应名词短语)

        - 从属相关连词： as...as, so...that, such...that, (al)though...yet, if...then, whether...or 等(cf. no sooner...than / hardly...when 倒装)。

1. 掌握并列相关连词的组合
    - x either A nor B / x both A or B / x not only A also B 等。

1. 搞懂从属相关连词，尤其是 so [such]...that

    - 非相关句
        - x very [too (much), quite]... that
        - x so(such) ... if (which) 等。

    - 语法机构
        - so + adj / adv + that / such + a(an) + adj + n(单) [+ 形容词 + 名词(复)] + that等。
