# 不定式

1. **事先归纳不定式（原形动词和 to 不定式）的用法**
    - 原形（没有to）动词
        1. 位于情态动词的后面(I must go now.) (to 出现在 ought / used 之后)
        1. 位于 “主动语态的感官、使役动词 + O ” 的后面 [ He made me go (x to go.).] 
    - to 不定式：
        1. 名词的用法 —— 作为主语、主格表语、宾语（To see is to believe. I hate to lie.）
        1. 形容词的用法(The time to go is now.)
        1. 副词的用法( I came here to see you.)

1. **在与不定式有关的句子结构中，感官动词和使役动词是最大的攻略目标**
    - “感官动词 + O + 原形动词” 句子结构 **->** 在被动句中出现 to 不定式 (I saw him cross the street. **->** He was seen to cross the street.)
    - 不过， watch, look at 不可以用于被动语态的句子结构中(They watched her go out of the room. **->** x She was watched to go out of the room.)
    - 使役动词：
        1. get [cause, etc.] + O + to 不定式
        1. make [have, let, etc.] + O + 原形动词 [ make 在被动句中，后面接 to 不定式 (I was made to go there.) / have 在被动语态的句子结构中，后面不可接to不定式, let.后面接to不定式的情况很少]

1. **了解在感官[使役]动词的句子结构中，O后面接分词的情况**
    - I saw him crossing the street. He had his shoes shined. etc.
