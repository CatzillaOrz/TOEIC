# I WANT TO STUDY, BUT I CAN’T CONCENTRATE

I find school, for the most part, easy. However, the one thing that I, and many others, struggle with is [staying focused when studying](http://www.k-state.edu/counseling/topics/career/concentr.html).

- For me, it’s all the distractions. There are iPods, TV, games consoles, magazines, and even siblings can be a distraction! But, the main distraction is myself. I find it very hard to block out everything else and focus on studying.

- I don’t know why, but having to focus leaves me no choice but to find myself a distraction!

- I have tried many different approaches, techniques, and tips to help me sit and concentrate. The few that work for me are:

  - Find a quiet workspace away form other distractions and make it into your study space.
  - Pace. I create a plan to study for 20 minutes, and then take a 5-minute break.
  - Simplify notes to few words. Then, on the test, it’s easy to expand on concepts.
  - Don’t keep re-reading the same notes. If they don’t make sense, I find other sources on the same topic to study from.

- I have followed these since I was in grade 8 and it has always been easy for me to study ever since! Do you find it hard not to become distracted?
