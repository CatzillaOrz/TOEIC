# 时态的表现形式

1. **归纳时态的表现形式**

    时态的表现形式是三种基本时态（现在时，过去时，将来时）和完成时、进行时的组合：

    He writes *[wrote, will write, is writing, was writing, will be writing, has written, had written, will have written, has been writing, had been writing, will have been writing]*。

1. **掌握作为选择时态基准的句子结构类型以及表示时间的副词【短语、从句】**

    He died [**x** has died] in 1960. / I've known [**x** know] her since 1960. 等。

1. **应注意表示时间、条件的副词从句内所使用的“代替将来时的现在时态”**

    I'll write to her when I have [**x** will have] time. 等。

1. **掌握和了解那些不能用于进行时的动词**

    He owns [**x** is owning] three cars.
